# Stacked PRs Workflow

## Mental Model

A stack is a chain: `main ← PR1 ← PR2 ← PR3`. Each PR targets the one below it, except the bottom which targets main. The stack is a sequence of logical changes that build on each other.

## PR Targeting

- **Only the bottom PR targets main.**
- PR2 targets PR1's branch
- PR3 targets PR2's branch
- If you're confused about what targets what, run `gh pr view --json baseRefName`

## Merging a Stack

When the bottom PR is approved:

1. Merge PR1 into main (normal merge, not squash)
2. **Stop.** Don't script the rest.
3. Checkout PR2's branch
4. `git rebase main`
5. If conflicts arise: **read them.** Open the file, look at both versions, edit to synthesize. Never `--ours` or `--theirs` blindly.
6. After resolving, `git rebase --continue`
7. Force push PR2's branch
8. Now PR2 targets main. Update the PR base if needed: `gh pr edit --base main`
9. Repeat for PR3, rebasing onto PR2's (now updated) branch

## Conflict Resolution Philosophy

Conflicts mean two changes touched the same place. The answer is almost never "pick one." The answer is usually "both changes were intended, integrate them."

- Open the conflicted file in an editor
- Read the `<<<<<<<` section (theirs) and `>>>>>>>` section (ours)
- Write what the code *should* be given both intentions
- Remove the conflict markers
- Test if possible before continuing

## What NOT to Do

- Don't write a bash loop that rebases all branches
- Don't use `-X ours` or `-X theirs`
- Don't resolve conflicts without reading them
- Don't try to update all PR targets at once
- Don't delete branches until the whole stack is merged

## Checking Stack State

```bash
# See what a PR targets
gh pr view <pr-number> --json baseRefName,headRefName

# See all your open PRs
gh pr list --author @me

# See commit graph
git log --oneline --graph main..HEAD
```

## Updating a PR Mid-Stack

If you need to make changes to PR1 while PR2 and PR3 exist:

1. Make changes on PR1's branch, commit, push
2. Checkout PR2's branch
3. `git rebase PR1-branch` (not main!)
4. Resolve conflicts one at a time, reading each one
5. Force push PR2
6. Repeat for PR3, rebasing onto PR2
